# hapi-auth
A simple node project, for practice with hapi authentication.

## Notes
* I followed and completed the example for hapi-basic-auth (hapi authentication tutorial)
    - documentation a little sparse, or difficult fully understand (lot of config options, which I don't yet see the use for)
    - however the sample works, and gained some understanding and practice
* QUESTION, determine the source of the authentication popup dialog (hapi-basic-auth, or browser)
* Gained some understanding and practice with gulp
* Gained much better understanding of bcrypt, and how to use
* Discovered minimist plugin. Very handy for using command line arguments.
